INSERT INTO `author_description` VALUES (1,1,'Aristotle (384-322 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. Along with Plato, Aristotle is considered the \"Father of Western Philosophy\", which from his teachings inherited almost its entire lexicon, including problems and methods of inquiry, so influencing almost any form of knowledge known to the modern world.\n\nHis father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato\'s Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC.\n\nTeaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies. He established a library in the Lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books, which were written on papyrus scrolls.[8] The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of Platonism, but, following Plato\'s death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism.[9] He believed all peoples\' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception. Aristotle\'s views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works.\n\nAristotle\'s views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Their influence extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance, and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics. Some of Aristotle\'s zoological observations, such as on the hectocotyl (reproductive) arm of the octopus, were not confirmed or refuted until the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern formal logic.\n\nIn metaphysics, Aristotelianism profoundly influenced Jewish and Islamic philosophical and theological thought during the Middle Ages and continues to influence Christian theology, especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church. Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim scholars, and has been revered as \"The First Teacher\" .\n\nHis ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics. All aspects of Aristotle\'s philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues Cicero described his literary style as \"a river of gold\" it is thought that only around a third of his original output has survived.'),(2,3,'Ayn Rand (February 2 [O.S. January 20] 1905  March 6, 1982) was a Russian-American novelist, philosopher, playwright, and screenwriter. She is known for her two best-selling novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and for developing a philosophical system she called Objectivism. Educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935 and 1936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead. In 1957, Rand published her best-known work, the novel Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982.\r\n\r\nRand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism, instead supporting laissez-faire capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights, including property rights. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and classical liberals.\r\n\r\nLiterary critics received Rand\'s fiction with mixed reviews, and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased in recent decades. The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings. She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives.'),(3,7,'Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche(15 October 1844  25 August 1900) was a German philosopher, cultural critic, composer, poet, philologist, and Latin and Greek scholar whose work has exerted a profound influence on Western philosophy and modern intellectual history. He began his career as a classical philologist before turning to philosophy. He became the youngest ever to hold the Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Basel in 1869 at the age of 24.  He resigned in 1879 due to health problems that plagued him most of his life, and he completed much of his core writing in the following decade. In 1889, at age 44, he suffered a collapse and a complete loss of his mental faculties. He lived his remaining years in the care of his mother until her death in 1897, and then with his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, and died in 1900.\n\nNietzsche\'s body of work touched widely on art, philology, history, religion, tragedy, culture, and science, and drew early inspiration from figures such as Schopenhauer, Wagner, and Goethe. His writing spans philosophical polemics, poetry, cultural criticism, and fiction while displaying a fondness for aphorism and irony. Some prominent elements of his philosophy include his radical critique of truth in favor of perspectivism; his genealogical critique of religion and Christian morality, and his related theory of masterslave morality;his aesthetic affirmation of existence in response to the \"death of God\" and the profound crisis of nihilism;[8] his notion of the Apollonian and Dionysian; and his characterization of the human subject as the expression of competing wills, collectively understood as the will to power. He also developed influential concepts such as the Übermensch and the doctrine of eternal return. In his later work, he became increasingly preoccupied with the creative powers of the individual to overcome social, cultural, and moral contexts in pursuit of new values and aesthetic health.\n\nAfter his death, Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche became the curator and editor of her brother\'s manuscripts, reworking Nietzsche\'s unpublished writings to fit her own German nationalist ideology while often contradicting or obfuscating his stated opinions, which were explicitly opposed to antisemitism and nationalism. Through her published editions, Nietzsche\'s work became associated with fascism and Nazism; 20th century scholars contested this interpretation of his work and corrected editions of his writings were soon made available. His thought enjoyed renewed popularity in the 1960s, and his ideas have since had a profound impact on 20th and early-21st century thinkers across philosophyespecially in schools of continental philosophy such as existentialism, postmodernism, and post-structuralismas well as art, literature, psychology, politics, and popular culture.'),(5,6,'Benjamin Franklin (January 17, 1706 - April 17, 1790) was a renowned polymath and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Franklin was a leading author, printer, political theorist, politician, freemason, postmaster, scientist, inventor, humorist, civic activist, statesman, and diplomat. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. As an inventor, he is known for the lightning rod, bifocals, and the Franklin stove, among other inventions. He founded many civic organizations, including Philadelphia\'s fire department and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nFranklin earned the title of \"The First American\" for his early and indefatigable campaigning for colonial unity, initially as an author and spokesman in London for several colonies. As the first United States Ambassador to France, he exemplified the emerging American nation. Franklin was foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of the practical values of thrift, hard work, education, community spirit, self-governing institutions, and opposition to authoritarianism both political and religious, with the scientific and tolerant values of the Enlightenment. In the words of historian Henry Steele Commager, \"In a Franklin could be merged the virtues of Puritanism without its defects, the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat.\"To Walter Isaacson, this makes Franklin \"the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential in inventing the type of society America would become.\"\n\nFranklin became a successful newspaper editor and printer in Philadelphia, the leading city in the colonies, publishing the Pennsylvania Gazette at the age of 23. He became wealthy publishing this and Poor Richard\'s Almanack, which he authored under the pseudonym \"Richard Saunders\". After 1767, he was associated with the Pennsylvania Chronicle, a newspaper that was known for its revolutionary sentiments and criticisms of the British policies.\n\nHe pioneered and was first president of Academy and College of Philadelphia which opened in 1751 and later became the University of Pennsylvania. He organized and was the first secretary of the American Philosophical Society and was elected president in 1769. Franklin became a national hero in America as an agent for several colonies when he spearheaded an effort in London to have the Parliament of Great Britain repeal the unpopular Stamp Act. An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired among the French as American minister to Paris and was a major figure in the development of positive Franco-American relations. His efforts proved vital for the American Revolution in securing shipments of crucial munitions from France.\n\nHe was promoted to deputy postmaster-general for the British colonies in 1753, having been Philadelphia postmaster for many years, and this enabled him to set up the first national communications network. During the Revolution, he became the first United States Postmaster General. He was active in community affairs and colonial and state politics, as well as national and international affairs. From 1785 to 1788, he served as governor of Pennsylvania. He initially owned and dealt in slaves but, by the 1750s, he argued against slavery from an economic perspective and became one of the most prominent abolitionists.\n\nHis colorful life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and his status as one of America\'s most influential Founding Fathers, have seen Franklin honored more than two centuries after his death on coinage and the $100 bill, warships, and the names of many towns, counties, educational institutions, and corporations, as well as countless cultural references.'),(6,21,'Ludwig Heinrich Edler von Mises (29 September 1881  10 October 1973) was an Austrian-American theoretical Austrian School economist. Mises wrote and lectured extensively on behalf of classical liberalism. He is best known for his work on praxeology, a study of human choice and action.\n\nMises emigrated from Austria to the United States in 1940. Since the mid-20th century, the libertarian movement in the United States has been strongly influenced by Mises\'s writings. Mises\'s student, Friedrich Hayek, viewed Mises as one of the major figures in the revival of liberalism in the post-war era. Hayek\'s work, \"The Transmission of the Ideals of Freedom\" (1951) pays high tribute to the influence of Mises in the twentieth century libertarian movement.\n\nMises\'s Austrian School was a leading group of economists. Many of its alumni, including Hayek and Oskar Morgenstern, emigrated from Austria to the United States and Great Britain. Mises has been described as having approximately seventy close students in Austria, and the Austrians as the insiders of the Chicago school of economics. The Ludwig von Mises Institute was founded in the United States to continue his teachings.'),(7,23,'Francis Bacon, 1st Viscount St Alban, (22 January 1561  9 April 1626) was an English philosopher, statesman, scientist, jurist, orator, and author. He served both as Attorney General and as Lord Chancellor of England. After his death, he remained extremely influential through his works, especially as philosophical advocate and practitioner of the scientific method during the scientific revolution.\n\nBacon has been called the father of empiricism. His works argued for the possibility of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature. Most importantly, he argued this could be achieved by use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. While his own practical ideas about such a method, the Baconian method, did not have a long-lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon the father of scientific method. This marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, the practical details of which are still central in debates about science and methodology today. In addition to his work in the sciences, Bacon was also a venerable patron of libraries and developed a functional system for the cataloging of books by dividing them into three categories- history, poesy, and philosophy- which could further be divided into more specific subjects and subheadings.\n\nBacon is the first recipient of the Queen\'s counsel designation and was conferred in 1597 when Queen Elizabeth reserved Bacon as her legal advisor. After the accession of King James I in 1603, Bacon was knighted. He was later created Baron Verulam in 1618 and Viscount St. Alban in 1621. Because he had no heirs, both titles became extinct upon his death in 1626, at 65 years of age. Bacon died of pneumonia, with one account by John Aubrey stating that he had contracted the condition while studying the effects of freezing on the preservation of meat. He is buried at St Michael\'s Church, St Albans, Hertfordshire.'),(8,29,'Ralph Waldo Emerson (May 25, 1803 - April 27, 1882) was an American essayist, lecturer, philosopher and poet who led the transcendentalist movement of the mid-19th century. He was seen as a champion of individualism and a prescient critic of the countervailing pressures of society, and he disseminated his thoughts through dozens of published essays and more than 1,500 public lectures across the United States.\n\nEmerson gradually moved away from the religious and social beliefs of his contemporaries, formulating and expressing the philosophy of transcendentalism in his 1836 essay \"Nature\". Following this work, he gave a speech entitled \"The American Scholar\" in 1837, which Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. considered to be America\'s \"intellectual Declaration of Independence\".\n\nEmerson wrote most of his important essays as lectures first and then revised them for print. His first two collections of essays, Essays: First Series (1841) and Essays: Second Series (1844), represent the core of his thinking. They include the well-known essays \"Self-Reliance\", \"The Over-Soul\", \"Circles\", \"The Poet\" and \"Experience\". Together with \"Nature\", these essays made the decade from the mid-1830s to the mid-1840s Emerson\'s most fertile period.\n\nEmerson wrote on a number of subjects, never espousing fixed philosophical tenets, but developing certain ideas such as individuality, freedom, the ability for mankind to realize almost anything, and the relationship between the soul and the surrounding world. Emerson\'s \"nature\" was more philosophical than naturalistic: \"Philosophically considered, the universe is composed of Nature and the Soul\". Emerson is one of several figures who \"took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world.\"\n\nHe remains among the linchpins of the American romantic movement, and his work has greatly influenced the thinkers, writers and poets that followed him. When asked to sum up his work, he said his central doctrine was \"the infinitude of the private man.\"Emerson is also well known as a mentor and friend of Henry David Thoreau, a fellow transcendentalist.'),(9,2,'Plato (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BC) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato\'s entire work is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.');

Show me the person they sleep with and I will tell you their valuation of themselves. No matter what corruption they\'re taught about the virtue of selflessness, sex is the most profoundly selfish of all acts, an act which they cannot perform for any motive but their own enjoyment - just try to think of performing it in a spirit of selfless charity! - an act which is not possible in self-abasement, only in self-exultation, only on the confidence of being desired and being worthy of desire. It is an act that forces them to stand naked in spirit, as well as in body, and accept their real ego as their standard of value.

Life consists of an infinite number of possibilities and the healthy person explores as many of them as posible.

For it is not continuous drinkings and revelings, nor the satisfaction of lusts, nor the enjoyment of fish and other luxuries of the wealthy table, which produce a pleasant life, but sober reasoning, searching out the motives for all choice and avoidance, and banishing mere opinions, to which are due the greatest disturbance of the spirit.'),(91,5,'A right understanding that death is nothing\r\nto us makes the mortality of life enjoyable, not because it adds to it\r\nan infinite span of time, but because it takes away the craving for\r\nimmortality.

What I\'ve learned is that a lie is an act of self-abdication, because one surrenders one\'s reality to the person to whom one lies, making that person one\'s master, condemning oneself from then on to faking the sort of reality that person\'s view requires to be faked.

Only the individual thinks. Only the individual reasons. Only the individual acts.'),(122,21,'Everyone carries a part of society on his shoulders; no one is relieved of his share of responsibility by others. And no one can find a safe way out for himself if society is sweeping toward destruction. Therefore, everyone, in his own interests, must thrust himself vigorously into the intellectual battle. None can stand aside with unconcern; the interest of everyone hangs on the result. Whether he chooses or not, every man is drawn into the great historical struggle, the decisive battle into which our epoch has plunged us.'),(126,21,'Once the principle is admitted that it is the duty of the government to protect the individual against his own foolishness, no serious objections can be advanced against further encroachments.'),(127,21,'Under capitalism the common man enjoys amenities which in ages gone by were unknown and therefore inaccessible even to the richest people. But, of course, these motorcars, television sets and refrigerators do not make a man happy. In the instant in which he acquires them, he may feel happier than he did before. But as soon as some of his wishes are satisfied, new wishes spring up. Such is human nature.'),(128,21,'The Marxians love of democratic institutions was a stratagem only, a pious fraud for the deception of the masses.

But even he fulfills a function in the life of the social organism. He sets an example of luxury that awakens in the multitude a consciousness of new needs and gives industry the incentive to fulfill them.'),(135,21,'All people, however fanatical they may be in their zeal to disparage and to fight capitalism, implicitly pay homage to it by passionately clamoring for the products it turns out.'),(136,21,'It is vain to fight totalitarianism by adopting totalitarian methods. Freedom can only be won by men unconditionally committed to the principles of freedom. The first requisite for a better social order is the return to unrestricted freedom of thought and speech.'),(137,21,'Nobody ever recommended a dictatorship aiming at ends other than those he himself approved. He who advocates dictatorship always advocates the unrestricted rule of his own will.'),(138,21,'It is not the fault of the entrepreneurs that the consumers,the people, the common man,prefer liquor to Bibles and detective stories to serious books, and that governments prefer guns to butter. The entrepreneur does not make greater profits in selling bad things than in selling good things. His profits are the greater the better he succeeds in providing the consumers with those things they ask for most intensely.'),(139,21,'The champions of socialism call themselves progressives, but they recommend a system which is characterized by rigid observance of routine and by a resistance to every kind of improvement. They call themselves liberals, but they are intent upon abolishing liberty. They call themselves democrats, but they yearn for dictatorship.

They promise the blessings of the Garden of Eden, but they plan to transform the world into a gigantic post office. Every man but one a subordinate clerk in a bureau'),(140,21,'The state is God, deifies arms and prisons. The worship of the state is the worship of force. There is no more dangerous menace to civilization than a government of incompetent, corrupt, or vile men. The worst evils which mankind ever had to endure were inﬂicted by bad governments. The state can be and has often been in the course of history the main source of mischief and disaster.'),(141,21,'As a rule, capitalism is blamed for the undesired effects of a policy directed\r\nat its elimination. The man who sips his morning coffee does not say, \"Capitalism has brought this beverage to my breakfast table.\" But when he reads in the papers that the government of Brazil has ordered part of the coffee crop destroyed, he does not say, \"That is government for you\"; he exclaims, \"That is capitalism for you.'),(142,21,'They (intellectuals) coined most of the slogans that guided the butcheries of Bolshevism, Fascism, and Nazism. Intellectuals extolling the delights of murder, writers advocating censorship, philosophers judging the merits of thinkers and authors, not according to the value of their contributions but according to their achievements on battlefields, are the spiritual leaders of our age of perpetual strife.'),(143,21,'The market system is the basis of our civilization. Its only alternative is the Führer principle.'),(144,21,'Repression by brute force is always a confession of the inability to make use of the better weapons of the intellect - better because they alone give promise of final success.'),(145,22,'There is nothing that is going to make people hate you more, and love you more, than telling the truth.'),(146,22,'Social anxiety results from being around people who are resolutely opposed to who you are.'),(147,22,'The only relationships that exist are based on truth. Everything else is just a mutual and isolating delusion.'),(148,22,'The only part of you that hurts when you\'re given the truth is the part that lives on lies.'),(149,22,'The law is an opinion with a gun.'),(150,22,'If you spend time with crazy and dangerous people, remember - their personalities are socially transmitted diseases; like water poured into a container, most of us eventually turn into - or remain - whoever we surround ourselves with. We can choose our tribe, but we cannot change that our tribe is our destiny.'),(151,22,'The idea that the State is capable of solving social problems is now viewed with great scepticism which foretells a coming change. As soon as scepticism is applied to the State, the State falls, since it fails at everything except increasing its power, and so can only survive on propaganda, which relies on unquestioning faith.'),(152,22,'Mental anguish always results from the avoidance of legitimate suffering.'),(153,22,'Anybody who tries to change society without examining the family is trying to push a shadow without moving a statue.'),(154,22,' I try not to be around people who want me to be somebody else. Fundamentally you can\'t be somebody else. You can only be less of who you are.'),(155,22,'SCREW CHILDREN! \r\nThat\'s the mantra of the world. \r\nInstead of burying them with a national debt, shoving them in shitty schools, drugging them if they don\'t comply, hitting them, yelling at them, indoctrinating them with religion and statism and patriotism and military worship, what if we just did what was right for them? The whole world is built on \"screw children\", and if we changed that, this would be an alien planet to us.'),(159,23,'Some books should be tasted, some devoured, but only a few should be chewed and digested thoroughly.'),(161,29,'To finish the moment, to find the journey\'s end in every step of the road, to live the greatest number of good hours, is wisdom.'),(162,29,'People wish to be settled; only as far as they are unsettled is there any hope for them.'),(163,29,'Shall I tell you the secret of the true scholar? It is this: every man I meet is my master in some point, and in that I learn of him.'),(164,29,'Men love to wonder, and that is the seed of science.'),(165,29,'Whoso would be a man, must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore it if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world.'),(166,29,'This time, like all times, is a very good one, if we but know what to do with it.'),(167,29,'A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best.'),(168,29,'Its the not the Destination, It\'s the Journey.'),(169,29,'Common sense is genius dressed in its working clothes.'),(170,29,'Life is a series of surprises and would not be worth taking or keeping if it were not.'),(171,29,'We are always getting ready to live but never living.'),(172,29,'Insist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift you can offer with the cumulative force of a whole life\'s cultivation, but of the adopted talent of another, you have only an extemporaneous, half possession.'),(173,29,'None of us will ever accomplish anything excellent or commanding except when he listens to this whisper which is heard by him alone.'),(174,22,'The idea that the State is capable of solving social problems is now viewed with great scepticism - which foretells a coming change. As soon as scepticism is applied to the State, the State falls, since it fails at everything except increasing its power, and so can only survive on propaganda, which relies on unquestioning faith.'),(175,22,'There\'s nothing lonelier than empty relationships. At least when you\'re alone you can be yourself, but when youre in empty relationships you cant even be yourself.\r\nYou can be real alone, or you can be a ghost with false friends.\r\nPulse proximity is not intimacy, and it\'s worse than no friends at all.'),(176,29,'Dare to live the life you have dreamed for yourself. Go forward and make your dreams come true.'),(177,29,'Whatever you do, you need courage. Whatever course you decide upon, there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong. There are always difficulties arising that tempt you to believe your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires some of the same courage that a soldier needs. Peace has its victories, but it takes brave men and women to win them.'),(178,23,'If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties.'),(179,23,'Hope is a good breakfast, but it is a bad supper.'),(180,23,'A wise man will make more opportunities than he finds.'),(181,23,'Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe and take for granted; nor to find talk and discourse; but to weigh and consider. Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested: that is, some books are to be read only in parts, others to be read, but not curiously, and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence and attention.'),(182,23,'There is no exquisite beauty... without some strangeness in the proportion.'),(183,23,'Imagination was given to man to compensate him for what he is not; a sense of humor to console him for what he is.'),(184,23,'Man prefers to believe what he prefers to be true.'),(185,23,'Begin doing what you want to do now.
